      <h1>Triangle Tracker</h1>
      <p>This program is going to allow to enter three figures in the boxes below for it to detect whether those figures can make a triangle,and  if they do make a triangle  which triangle that would be.</p>
      <p>Let us talk a little bbit out triangles:</p>
      <h3>What makes a triangle?</h3>
      <p>A triangle is made of three ligns each of which is given a length by a given number. When the addition of two sides length is less or equal to the third line's length a trianlge cannot be made </p>
      <h3>An equilateral Triangle</h3>
      <p>You will git an equilateral triangle if all the sides/lines length are equal.</p>
      <h3>An Isocele triangle</h3>
      <p>An isocele triangle is made of three sides, two of which are equal</p>
      <h3>A scalene triangle is a triangle which fulfills the conditions for a trianglem but of which no side is eaual to the other.</h3>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Input three digits in the <stron>(side)</stron>boxes</li>
      <li>Click the botton<strong>"check triangle"</strong> botton to see if the numbers make up a triangle. you should see a message popping up on top of the window</li>
      <li>If the message confirms that the numbers can make a triangle,  in the pop-up message click <strong>OK</strong> to see what type of triangle the numbers make</li>
    </ol>
